- **Users**: Admin, seller, and customer roles with specific permissions and access controls.
- **Payment Gateway**: Integrate and manage payment processes for customer orders.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js/Express**: Web framework for building the backend API.
- **MongoDB/Mongoose**: Database and ODM for storing and managing data.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt**: Password hashing and security.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **Joi**: Schema validation.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Dotenv**: Environment variable management.
- **Nanoid**: Unique ID generation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce-backend.git
    cd e-commerce-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Setup environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```bash
    PORT=your_port_number
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_payment_gateway_api_key
    ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the server in development mode**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
   This will start the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server when code changes are detected.

2. **Start the server in production mode**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   This will start the server normally without the automatic restart feature.

3. **Access the API**:
   Once the server is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:<PORT>` where `<PORT>` is the port number specified in your `.env` file.
